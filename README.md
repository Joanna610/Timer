#  Timer

The aim of the project was to design a timer system in KiCad and implement it in the laboratory using boards and electronic components provided by the teacher. 
The timer included a counter that counting down the time. At the first output, after pressing the button, the bulb lights up. When the counter finishes, 
the bulb turns off and a short signal appears on the second output, which activates the buzzer.

The project used a digital system that allows programming and counting time in the range of 0â€“9 seconds (time units), with a resolution of 1 second. It contains 4-bit parallel programming: dip-switch. 
Counting direction down. From 9 to 0.

My task was the signal-generating systems, i.e., the appropriate configuration of 555 systems but not only. Together with my friend, we created the entire scheme and soldered the elements.
